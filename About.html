    <h2>A crime free society</h2>
    <h3>Who are we</h3>
    <p>Form ni kureform is a non governmeantal organisation based in kibera since the year 2007.Started as an anti-crime advocacy and lobby group in 2007 in the Death Row Section of the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison, and formally registered as a non-governmental organization in 2010, the Youth Safety Awareness Initiative popularly known by its Swahili brand name, Crime Si Poa® (meaning crime is not cool) is anchored on three key pillars, namely: education, advocacy and social enterprise. </p>
    <p>Our aim is to mobilize communities to build ownership around safety, justice <a href="Read more"></a> and socio-economic issues. We therefore primarily focus on discouraging at risk and vulnerable youth from engaging in criminal activities and address threats to peace through behavioral and attitudinal change while promoting the benefits of a crime-free society.</p>
    <p>Throughout history people have tried to explain what causes abnormal social behavior, including crime. Efforts to control "bad" behavior go back to ancient Babylon's Code of Hammurabi some 3,700 years ago. Later in the seventeenth century European colonists in North America considered crime and sin the same thing. They believed evil spirits possessed those who did not conform to social norms or follow rules. To maintain social order in the settlements, persons who exhibited antisocial behavior had to be dealt with swiftly and often harshly.</p>
    <p>Form ni kureform organisation came up with some ways of helping youths to avoid crime and engage in more productive activities such as businesses and going to school to gain new knowledge</p>
